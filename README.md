Scripts I wrote for PDF manipulation because I got tired of having to deal with bloated propietary software just to merge/split PDF files.

**DIRECTIONS**:

1. Make sure you have [PyPDF2 installed](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.0/user/installation.html) (and [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/) for the GUI scripts).
2. Install the desired script and run it through whatever IDE you want.
